In this episode of Foresight, Ian Khan delves into the role of platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube in amplifying disinformation, shaping public behavior, and contributing to the events that unfolded.\n\nHow much responsibility lies with social media companies? Should tech giants like Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey be held accountable? Ian explores the impact of algorithms, user behavior, and content moderation policies, while also addressing broader implications such as Section 230 reform and the balance between freedom of speech and regulation.\n\nJoin us as we examine the complex relationship between technology, politics, and society\u2014and the lessons we must learn to build a safer, more responsible digital future.\n\nThe US Capitol attack this week has been all over the news as it has been a shocking incident. In this episode of 4Sight, I analyze whether Social Media companies including Facebook, Twitter, and others should be held responsible for providing a platform for terrorist and racist organizations that finally led to the attack on the US Capitol.\n\nThis thought-provoking episode also highlights how the same platforms used to organize and amplify unrest are now being leveraged to hold individuals accountable. From identifying rioters to sparking debates on corporate power, we uncover the double-edged nature of social media's role in modern society.\n\nThanks for watching this video!

In this episode of Foresight, Ian Khan delves into the role of platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube in amplifying disinformation, shaping public behavior, and contributing to the events that unfolded.\n\nHow much responsibility lies with social media companies? Should tech giants like Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey be held accountable? Ian explores the impact of algorithms, user behavior, and content moderation policies, while also addressing broader implications such as Section 230 reform and the balance between freedom of speech and regulation.\n\nJoin us as we examine the complex relationship between technology, politics, and society\u2014and the lessons we must learn to build a safer, more responsible digital future.\n\nThe US Capitol attack this week has been all over the news as it has been a shocking incident. In this episode of 4Sight, I analyze whether Social Media companies including Facebook, Twitter, and others should be held responsible for providing a platform for terrorist and racist organizations that finally led to the attack on the US Capitol.\n\nThis thought-provoking episode also highlights how the same platforms used to organize and amplify unrest are now being leveraged to hold individuals accountable. From identifying rioters to sparking debates on corporate power, we uncover the double-edged nature of social media's role in modern society.\n\nThanks for watching this video!

Bolsonaro has been a staunch backer of Trump, ditching Brazil\u2019s multilateral approach to foreign policy to fully align his country to the U.S.\n\n\u201cYou know I am connected to Trump, you know my response,\u201d he said, adding that there \u201chave been many reports of fraud\u201d in the U.S. election. Bolsonaro also said he believed the 2018 Brazilian election -- which he won in a runoff -- was riddled with fraud. \u201cThere was fraud during mine.

Although well known for his admiration of the outgoing president, the British leader said \u201cit is now vital that there should be a peaceful and orderly transfer of power.\u201d\n\nAnother leader who has previously voiced support of Trump, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, called the scenes \u201cvery distressing\u201d and said he was looking forward to a peaceful transfer of power.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a radio interview that his government was \u201cconcerned.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re following the situation minute by minute as it unfolds,\u201d he said. Japan, one of the U.S.\u2019s most powerful allies in Asia, was watching \u201cwith concern\u201d the situation at the U.S. Capitol, chief government spokesman Katsunobu Kato told reporters.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed anger and sadness over the images from Washington. \u201cI regret very much that President Trump has not recognized his defeat since November, and again yesterday,\u201d she told reporters in Berlin. \u201cDoubt was sown about the election result and that created the atmosphere for the events of yesterday evening.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rampage at the Capitol yesterday was a disgraceful act that must be vigorously condemned,\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said during a meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, according to his office. \u201cI have no doubt that American democracy will prevail -- it always has.\u201d\n\nCzech Premier Andrej Babis, also a billionaire businessman-turned politician, ditched his social-media profile picture in which he was wearing a red hat mimicking the U.S. president\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that it was inspired by Trump,\u201d Babis told the Czech news website Idnes.cz. \u201cAfter the unprecedented attack on democracy that happened in the U.S., which I unequivocally condemned, I found it appropriate to express my stance by also changing my profile picture.\u201d\n\nTheir comments came after President-elect Joe Biden -- whose victory was confirmed by Congress early Thursday -- used a televised appearance to urge Americans to \u201cthink what the rest of the world is looking at\u201d when they viewed the chaotic scenes from Washington.\n\nWhile some European lawmakers issued statements backing U.S. institutions and its democracy to overcome the turmoil, others were more condemning of the president and his supporters.\n\n\u201cThe enemies of democracy will rejoice at these unbelievable images out of Washington,\u201d said German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas. \u201cInflammatory words reap violent deeds.\u201d Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said \u201cshame on those who have incited this attack on democracy.\u201d\n\nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said on Twitter that the storming of the capital was \u201ca deliberate assault on Democracy by a sitting president,\u201d adding that \u201cthe world is watching.\u201d Carl Bildt, co-chair of the European Council on Foreign Relations, said his \u201csincere hope is that the evil man who bears the responsibility ultimately will suffer the consequences.\u201d\n\nOther leaders on friendly terms with Trump played down their comments.\n\nBrazil\u2019s President Jair Bolsonaro told supporters outside the presidential palace in Brasilia that he stood by Trump. Bolsonaro has been a staunch backer of Trump, ditching Brazil\u2019s multilateral approach to foreign policy to fully align his country to the U.S.\n\n\u201cYou know I am connected to Trump, you know my response,\u201d he said, adding that there \u201chave been many reports of fraud\u201d in the U.S. election. Bolsonaro also said he believed the 2018 Brazilian election -- which he won in a runoff -- was riddled with fraud. \u201cThere was fraud during mine. I should have won in the first round,\u201d he said.\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8Gm\n\nBloomberg Quicktake brings you live global news and original shows spanning business, technology, politics and culture.
