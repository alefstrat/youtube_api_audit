In front of more than a thousand people gathered at a park south of the White House Wednesday Trump said he wouldn\u2019t concede his loss in the election, which he claims without evidence was tainted by vote fraud.\n\n\u201cWe will never give up, we will never concede,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cWe won this election. We won it in a landslide.\u201d\n\nLater, he urged his supporters to stay peaceful and respect the police. But he also excoriated Pence for not trying to block the electoral count.\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel:\u00a0https://bit.ly/2TwO8Gm\n\nBloomberg Quicktake brings you live global news and original shows spanning business, technology, politics and culture.

She was hospitalized with a gunshot wound and later died.\r\n\r\nD.C. police officials also say two pipe bombs were recovered, one outside the Democratic National Committee and one outside the Republican National Committee. Police found a cooler from a vehicle that had a long gun and Molotov cocktail on Capitol grounds.\r\n\r\nThe riot interrupted Congress\u2019 Electoral College count that will formalize Biden\u2019s upcoming inauguration on Jan. 20. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the joint session would resume Wednesday night.\r\n\r\nThe National Guard and state and federal police were called in for control, and the mayor of Washington imposed a rare evening curfew. A woman who was shot inside the Capitol during the violence has died, a source told the Associated Press. \r\n\r\nThe Trump supporters were egged on by the president and his false attacks on the integrity of the November presidential election. While rallying his supporters outside the White House Wednesday morning, he urged them to march to the Capitol. But later \u2014 hours after they fought police and breached the building \u2014 he told them that although they were \"very special people\u201d and he backed their cause, they should \u201cgo home in peace.\u201d\r\n\r\nPresident-elect Biden, two weeks away from being inaugurated, had declared in Wilmington, Delaware: \"I call on President Trump to go on national television now to fulfill his oath and defend the Constitution and demand an end to this siege,\u201d\r\n\r\nBiden said that democracy was \u2019\u201cunder unprecedented assault,\" a sentiment echoed by many in Congress, including some Republicans.\r\n\r\nThe violent riot halted Congress\u2019 constitutionally mandated counting of the Electoral College results, in which Biden defeated Trump, 306-232.\r\n\r\nRepublican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had tried to steer Congress away from Wednesday's formal protest of those results, and he said at the start of proceedings that Trump had clearly lost.\r\n\r\nWednesday\u2019s ordinarily mundane procedure of Congress certifying a new president was always going to be extraordinary, with Republican supporters of Trump vowing to protest election results that have been certified by the states. But even the unusual deliberations, which included Vice President Mike Pence and Senate Majority Leader McConnell defying Trump\u2019s demands, were quickly overtaken by the chaos.\r\n\r\nIn a raucous, out-of-control scene, Trump supporters fought past police and breached the building, shouting and waving Trump and American flags as they marched through the halls.

She was hospitalized with a gunshot wound and later died.\r\n\r\nD.C. police officials also say two pipe bombs were recovered, one outside the Democratic National Committee and one outside the Republican National Committee. Police found a cooler from a vehicle that had a long gun and Molotov cocktail on Capitol grounds.\r\n\r\nThe riot interrupted Congress\u2019 Electoral College count that will formalize Biden\u2019s upcoming inauguration on Jan. 20. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the joint session would resume Wednesday night.\r\n\r\nThe National Guard and state and federal police were called in for control, and the mayor of Washington imposed a rare evening curfew. A woman who was shot inside the Capitol during the violence has died, a source told the Associated Press. \r\n\r\nThe Trump supporters were egged on by the president and his false attacks on the integrity of the November presidential election. While rallying his supporters outside the White House Wednesday morning, he urged them to march to the Capitol. But later \u2014 hours after they fought police and breached the building \u2014 he told them that although they were \"very special people\u201d and he backed their cause, they should \u201cgo home in peace.\u201d\r\n\r\nPresident-elect Biden, two weeks away from being inaugurated, had declared in Wilmington, Delaware: \"I call on President Trump to go on national television now to fulfill his oath and defend the Constitution and demand an end to this siege,\u201d\r\n\r\nBiden said that democracy was \u2019\u201cunder unprecedented assault,\" a sentiment echoed by many in Congress, including some Republicans.\r\n\r\nThe violent riot halted Congress\u2019 constitutionally mandated counting of the Electoral College results, in which Biden defeated Trump, 306-232.\r\n\r\nRepublican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had tried to steer Congress away from Wednesday's formal protest of those results, and he said at the start of proceedings that Trump had clearly lost.\r\n\r\nWednesday\u2019s ordinarily mundane procedure of Congress certifying a new president was always going to be extraordinary, with Republican supporters of Trump vowing to protest election results that have been certified by the states.

Outside the Capitol, the DC Metropolitan Police Department continues to mass, but no major move has been made yet toward the crowd.\nThe Capitol police officer in the House chamber told lawmakers that they may need to duck under their chairs and informed lawmakers that protesters were in the building's Rotunda. Lots of House members were seen wearing gas masks as they move between Capitol buildings. Members were calling family to say they are OK.\nWhile the White House refused to comment on the protests, Trump said on Twitter, \"Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!\"\nOthers inside the President's orbit tweeted their calls for calm as the mob repeatedly attempted to take over the building.\nDonald Trump Jr., the President's son, said that his supporters who mobbed the Capitol were \"wrong and not who we are.\"\n\"Be peaceful and use your 1st Amendment rights, but don't start acting like the other side. We have a country to save and this doesn't help anyone,\" he tweeted.\nThe protesters have breached exterior security barriers, and video footage shows protesters gathering and some clashing with police near the Capitol building. CNN's team on the ground saw a number of protestors trying to go up the side of the Capitol building. Several loud flash bangs have been heard.\nProtesters could be seen pushing against metal fences and police using the fences to push protesters back, while other officers reached over the top to club people trying to cross their lines.\nFlash bangs could be heard near the steps of the Capitol as smoke filled the air. In some instances officers could be seen deploying pepper spray. Tear gas has been deployed, but it's not clear whether by protesters or police, and people wiped tears from their eyes while coughing.\nWashington Mayor Muriel Bowser just announced a citywide curfew from 6 p.m. ET on Wednesday until 6 a.m. ET Thursday.\nFederal and local law enforcement are responding to reports of possible pipe bombs in multiple locations in Washington DC, according to a federal law enforcement official. It's unclear if the devices are real or a hoax, but they're being treated as real."}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-US"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT2M9S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": false, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "60212", "likeCount": "432", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "615"}}
