Sign Language is the natural language of the deaf since, with their missing sense of hearing, the deaf rely heavily on the sense of sight and touch for communication in their daily lives. Hence, every video of ISH News narrated in Indian Sign Language will greatly benefit the deaf people with access to information.\n\nThe inclusion of closed-captions and background voice ensures that the News is also accessible to the public and promotes the inclusion of all individuals, whilst maintaining the awareness on deafness. With this \u201cinclusion\u201d, our aim is to create equal opportunities for the people with disabilities."}, "country": "IN"}, "contentDetails": {"relatedPlaylists": {"likes": "", "uploads": "UU99w_Bzj8ikOz8Gpv0prbNg"}}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "251587810", "subscriberCount": "493000", "hiddenSubscriberCount": false, "videoCount": "6869"}}
