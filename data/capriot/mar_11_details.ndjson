There's been a lot of bipartisan talk about removing Trump from office. Van Hollen supports removing Trump from office and called the riot at the U.S. Capitol an \"attack on our democracy and needs to be remedied.\"\n\n\"You know I witnessed in the Capitol, one of these rioters taking down an American flag, and putting up in its place a Trump flag,\" Van Hollen said. \"In our country, we don't pledge allegiance to an individual, we respect our traditions of democratic peaceful transition of power. That's how we survived as a democracy for hundreds of years.\"\n\nVan Hollen said the 25th Amendment would be the fastest way to remove Trump, but if it isn't invoked by Vice President Mike Pence, the U.S. House of Representatives would introduce impeachment articles, which would make Trump the first president to be impeached twice.\n\nMontgomery Community Media (MCM) is the only independent, nonprofit organization providing access to public media (public access television and broadband media) directly to Montgomery County\u2019s over one million residents as well as the resident non-profit organizations, associations and businesses.

Trump incapable of executing the duties of his office and to immediately exercise powers as acting President,\" the resolution read.\n\nOn Monday, Democrats formally introduced an article of impeachment against Trump for \"inciting an insurrection\" in connection to the riot that took place at the Capitol building last Wednesday.\nCalls for Trump\u2019s removal have been rapidly building momentum after thousands of his supporters violently stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday in an attempt to prevent the certification of president-elect Joe Biden\u2019s election win.\n\nThis will be the second time the Republican president faces impeachment. In December 2019, Trump became the third U.S. president to have ever been impeached.\n\n The only other two sitting presidents to have been impeached are Bill Clinton, who was impeached in 1998, and Andrew Johnson was impeached in 1868.\n\nFor more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/7566021/article-of-impeachment-trump-monday/\n\nSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDc\nLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQ\nFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mt\nFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB\n#Politics #DonaldTrump #Impeachment #GlobalNews #uspoli"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-CA"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT8M4S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "180263", "likeCount": "1215", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "1131"}}
