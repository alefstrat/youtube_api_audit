A video circulating on social media showed a woman falling from the window of a doorway in the Capitol, apparently after being shot.\n\nThree other people died from medical emergencies that arose during the riot.\n\nVice President Mike Pence, who had been presiding over the count of Electoral College votes, was rushed out of the Senate as the Capitol complex went into lockdown when Trump supporters began pouring into the building.\n\nPence, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who are all in the line of presidential succession were taken to secure locations.\n\nMembers of Congress were ordered to take shelter in the complex, where at least one improvised explosive device was found. Another pipe-bomb-like device was found at the headquarters of the Republican National Committee.\n\nAs rioters, many of them clad in hats bearing Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d motto, rampaged, Senate staffers removed the Electoral College ballots that had been on the floor of the Senate during proceedings, according to Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore.\n\n\u201cif our capable floor staff hadn\u2019t grabbed them, they would have been burned by the mob,\u201d Merkley tweeted.\n\nOther tweets and broadcasts showed shocking images of a protester dangling from the balcony of the Senate chamber, a woman drenched in blood on a stretcher and Capitol police pointing guns on the floor of the House of Representatives.\n\nMembers of Congress were photographed wearing plastic breathing devices over their heads to protect themselves from tear gas. CNN broadcast an image of protester sitting at Pelosi\u2019s desk, with a handwritten note near her computer that read, \u201cWE WILL NOT BACK DOWN.\u201d\n\nHours after the riot began, authorities began tossing flash-bang grenades and dispersing tear gas into a crowd of people in front of the Capitol building.\n\n\u201cThis is a coup attempt,\u201d tweeted Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican.\n\nRepublican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah blamed Trump for the riot.\n\n\u201cThis is what the president has caused today, this insurrection,\u201d said Romney, the GOP\u2019s 2012 presidential nominee.\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic\n\nTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

Another pipe-bomb-like device was found at the headquarters of the Republican National Committee.\n\nAs rioters, many of them clad in hats bearing Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d motto, rampaged, Senate staffers removed the Electoral College ballots that had been on the floor of the Senate during proceedings, according to Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore.\n\n\u201cif our capable floor staff hadn\u2019t grabbed them, they would have been burned by the mob,\u201d Merkley tweeted.\n\nOther tweets and broadcasts showed shocking images of a protester dangling from the balcony of the Senate chamber, a woman drenched in blood on a stretcher and Capitol police pointing guns on the floor of the House of Representatives.\n\nMembers of Congress were photographed wearing plastic breathing devices over their heads to protect themselves from tear gas. CNN broadcast an image of protester sitting at Pelosi\u2019s desk, with a handwritten note near her computer that read, \u201cWE WILL NOT BACK DOWN.\u201d\n\nHours after the riot began, authorities began tossing flash-bang grenades and dispersing tear gas into a crowd of people in front of the Capitol building.\n\n\u201cThis is a coup attempt,\u201d tweeted Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican.\n\nRepublican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah blamed Trump for the riot.\n\n\u201cThis is what the president has caused today, this insurrection,\u201d said Romney, the GOP\u2019s 2012 presidential nominee.\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic\n\nTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

(Jan. 11)\r\n\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi says the House will proceed with legislation to impeach President Donald Trump as she pushes the vice president and the Cabinet to invoke constitutional authority to force him out, warning that Trump is a threat to democracy and could do more damage before he leaves office.\n\nLast week, an angry mob overpowered police, broke through security lines and windows, and rampaged through the Capitol, forcing lawmakers to scatter as they were finalizing Biden's victory over Trump in the Electoral College.\n\nWhile some have questioned impeaching the president so close to the end of his term, Democrats and others argue he must be held accountable for his actions and prevented from ever again seeking public office.\n\nJulie Pace, the Washington Bureau Chief for the Associated Press, said Trump would be the only president twice impeached.\n\n\"We notably have also seen a few Republicans, not many, but a few who have called for Trump to resign,\" Pace said. \"They don't want to wait the 10 more days that they have to go through before he is out of power. They want to take some action now.\"\n\nOn Monday, a House resolution calling on Vice President Pence to invoke constitutional authority to remove Trump from office was blocked by Republicans. However, the full House is set to hold a roll call vote on that resolution on Tuesday, and it is expected to pass.\n\nAfter that, Pelosi said Pence will have 24 hours to respond.\n\n\"At this point, we don't have an expectation that that will happen,\" Pace said. \"We're told from sources that Mike Pence is not prepared to invoke the 25th Amendment, though we are also told that he has not ruled it out completely.\"\n\nNext, the House would proceed to impeachment. Trump faces a single charge - \"incitement of insurrection\" - and a vote on the impeachment resolution could come Wednesday.\n\n\"This will be very different than the impeachment that we saw a year ago,\" Pace said. \"This is not going to be a lengthy process on the House floor. We're not going to see tons of witnesses called forward. Everyone knows what happened here. This all happened in public view.\"\n\nOn impeachment, House Democrats would likely delay for 100 days sending articles of impeachment to the Senate for trial, to allow Biden to focus on other priorities.\n\nThere is precedent for pursuing impeachment after officials leave office. In 1876, during the Ulysses Grant administration, War Secretary William Belknap was impeached by the House the day he resigned, and the Senate convened a trial months later. He was acquitted.\n\r\nSubscribe for more Breaking News: http://smarturl.it/AssociatedPress \r\nWebsite: https://apnews.com\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP\r\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/APNews\r\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/115892241801867723374\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/de143e9f1f80443886c0eb645871c65e", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zz9Ll3RvWKs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zz9Ll3RvWKs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zz9Ll3RvWKs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zz9Ll3RvWKs/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zz9Ll3RvWKs/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Associated Press", "tags": ["Associated Press", "news", "apus145189", "c1d0150957dc47aebc83fb67b4e8a78c", "US Capitol Riot 25 Amendment Debrief (CR)", "Donald Trump", "Mike Pence", "Julie Pace", "District of Columbia", "United States", "Nancy Pelosi", "Michael Pence", "Government and politics", "United States presidential election", "Media", "2021 United States Capitol riot"], "categoryId": "25", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "House looks to oust Trump after US Capitol riot", "description": "Members of Congress are pursuing methods to force President Donald Trump to leave office and accuse Trump of inciting the deadly assault on the US Capitol on Wednesday in support of his false claims of election fraud.

Trump faces a single charge - \"incitement of insurrection\" - and a vote on the impeachment resolution could come Wednesday.\n\n\"This will be very different than the impeachment that we saw a year ago,\" Pace said. \"This is not going to be a lengthy process on the House floor. We're not going to see tons of witnesses called forward. Everyone knows what happened here. This all happened in public view.\"\n\nOn impeachment, House Democrats would likely delay for 100 days sending articles of impeachment to the Senate for trial, to allow Biden to focus on other priorities.\n\nThere is precedent for pursuing impeachment after officials leave office. In 1876, during the Ulysses Grant administration, War Secretary William Belknap was impeached by the House the day he resigned, and the Senate convened a trial months later. He was acquitted.\n\r\nSubscribe for more Breaking News: http://smarturl.it/AssociatedPress \r\nWebsite: https://apnews.com\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP\r\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/APNews\r\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/115892241801867723374\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/de143e9f1f80443886c0eb645871c65e"}}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT2M6S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "sd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "12208", "likeCount": "39", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "16"}}

It is located on Capitol Hill at the eastern end of the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Though no longer at the geographic center of the federal district, the Capitol forms the origin point for the district's street-numbering system and the district's four quadrants.\n\nThe original building was completed in 1800. It was partly destroyed in the 1814 burning of Washington, then was fully restored within five years. The building was later enlarged, with the addition of a massive dome, and extended wings with expanded chambers for the bicameral legislature, the House of Representatives in the south wing and the Senate in the north wing. Like the principal buildings of the executive and judicial branches, the Capitol is built in the neoclassical style and has a white exterior. Both its east and west elevations are formally referred to as fronts, though only the east front was intended for the reception of visitors and dignitaries.\n\nHistory\nPrior to establishing the nation's capital in Washington, D.C., the United States Congress and its predecessors had met in Philadelphia (Independence Hall and Congress Hall), New York City (Federal Hall), and a number of other locations (York, Pennsylvania; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; the Maryland State House in Annapolis, Maryland; and Nassau Hall in Princeton, New Jersey). In September 1774, the First Continental Congress brought together delegates from the colonies in Philadelphia, followed by the Second Continental Congress, which met from May 1775 to March 1781.\n\n\u7f8e\u570b\u570b\u6703\u5927\u5ec8\n\u7f8e\u570b\u570b\u6703\u5927\u5ec8\uff08\u82f1\u8a9e\uff1aUnited States

It is located on Capitol Hill at the eastern end of the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Though no longer at the geographic center of the federal district, the Capitol forms the origin point for the district's street-numbering system and the district's four quadrants.\n\nThe original building was completed in 1800. It was partly destroyed in the 1814 burning of Washington, then was fully restored within five years. The building was later enlarged, with the addition of a massive dome, and extended wings with expanded chambers for the bicameral legislature, the House of Representatives in the south wing and the Senate in the north wing. Like the principal buildings of the executive and judicial branches, the Capitol is built in the neoclassical style and has a white exterior. Both its east and west elevations are formally referred to as fronts, though only the east front was intended for the reception of visitors and dignitaries.\n\nHistory\nPrior to establishing the nation's capital in Washington, D.C., the United States Congress and its predecessors had met in Philadelphia (Independence Hall and Congress Hall), New York City (Federal Hall), and a number of other locations (York, Pennsylvania; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; the Maryland State House in Annapolis, Maryland; and Nassau Hall in Princeton, New Jersey). In September 1774, the First Continental Congress brought together delegates from the colonies in Philadelphia, followed by the Second Continental Congress, which met from May 1775 to March 1781.\n\n\u7f8e\u570b\u570b\u6703\u5927\u5ec8\n\u7f8e\u570b\u570b\u6703\u5927\u5ec8\uff08\u82f1\u8a9e\uff1aUnited States Capitol\uff09\uff0c\u5225\u7a31\u570b\u6703\u5c71\u838a\uff0c\u662f\u7f8e\u570b\u570b\u6703\u6240\u5728\u5730\uff0c\u4f4d\u65bc\u7f8e\u570b\u9996\u90fd\u83ef\u76db\u9813\u7279\u5340\u7684\u570b\u6703\u5c71\uff0c\u5750\u843d\u5728\u83ef\u76db\u9813\u7279\u5340\u570b\u5bb6\u5ee3\u5834\u6771\u7aef\u3002\u5728\u5730\u7406\u4e0a\uff0c\u7f8e\u570b\u570b\u6703\u5927\u5ec8\u4f4d\u65bc\u83ef\u76db\u9813\u7279\u5340\u504f\u6771\u8655\uff0c\u4f46\u5e38\u88ab\u770b\u4f5c\u83ef\u76db\u9813\u7279\u5340\u53ca\u7f8e\u570b\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3002\u83ef\u76db\u9813\u7279\u5340\u5efa\u7bc9\u7269\u5730\u5740\u7684\u6771\u897f\u5357\u5317\uff0c\u90fd\u662f\u4ee5\u570b\u6703\u5927\u5ec8\u4f5c\u70ba\u57fa\u6e96\u3002\n\n\u5efa\u7bc9\n\u570b\u6703\u5927\u5ec8\u80cc\u9762\n\u5927\u5ec8\u6700\u521d\u7531\u5a01\u5ec9\u00b7\u6851\u9813\u535a\u58eb\u8a2d\u8a08\uff0c\u8a72\u5efa\u7bc9\u4ee5\u4e00\u500b\u5713\u5f62\u5927\u5ef3\u4e0a\u7684\u5713\u9802\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u7684\u5169\u7ffc\u4f5c\u70ba\u6a19\u8a18\u3002\u6bcf\u4e00\u7ffc\u4f5c\u70ba\u4e00\u500b\u8b70\u6703\u7684\u6240\u5728\u5730\uff0c\u5317\u7ffc\u662f\u7f8e\u570b\u53c3\u8b70\u9662\uff0c\u800c\u5357\u7ffc\u5247\u662f\u7f8e\u570b\u773e\u8b70\u9662\u3002\u5b83\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u5178\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u53e4\u5178\u5f0f\u5efa\u7bc9\u3002\u570b\u6703\u5927\u5ec8\u662f\u4e00\u5e62\u5168\u9577233\u7c73\u76843\u5c64\u5efa\u7bc9\uff0c\u4ee5\u767d\u8272\u5927\u7406\u77f3\u70ba\u4e3b\u6599\uff0c\u4e2d\u592e\u9802\u6a13\u4e0a\u5efa\u6709\u51fa\u93e1\u7387\u6975\u9ad8\u76843\u5c64\u5927\u5713\u9802\uff0c\u5713\u9802\u4e4b\u4e0a\u7acb\u6709\u4e00\u5c0a6\u7c73\u9ad8\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u5973\u795e\u9752\u9285\u96d5\u50cf\u3002\n\n\u7531\u65bc\u96fb\u8996\u65b0\u805e\u5831\u5c0e\u83ef\u5e9c\u4f5c\u51fa\u6c7a\u5b9a\u6642\u591a\u51fa\u73fe\u7684\u662f\u570b\u6703\u5927\u5ec8\uff0c\u52a0\u4e4b\u7d93\u5e38\u914d\u5408\u6709\u300c\u767d\u5bae\u65b9\u9762\u5ba3\u5e03\u300d\u7684\u8a00\u8fad\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u98a8\u683c\u5dcd\u5ce8\u633a\u62d4\uff0c\u5c0e\u81f4\u4e0d\u4e86\u89e3\u7684\u4eba\u5728\u5f88\u9577\u4e00\u6bb5\u6642\u9593\u5167\u5c07\u570b\u6703\u5927\u5ec8\u8a8d\u70ba\u662f\u767d\u5bae\u2014\u7f8e\u570b\u7e3d\u7d71\u5b98\u90b8\u66a8\u8fa6\u516c\u5ba4\u3002\n\n\u516c\u773e\u53ef\u514d\u8cbb\u53c3\u89c0\u570b\u6703\u5927\u5ec8\uff0c\u4f46\u6bcf\u5929\u7684\u540d\u984d\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u4e5f\u53ef\u65c1\u807d\u53c3\u8b70\u9662\u6216\u773e\u8b70\u9662\u8b70\u4e8b\uff0c\u4f46\u9808\u7d93\u7533\u8acb\u3002\n\nblogger https://jrchiang.blogspot.com/\n\nPixnet http://jrchiang2006.pixnet.net\n\ninstagram https://www.instagram.com/jrchiang_ig/\n\nfacebook https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000032068067\n\nTumblr https://www.tumblr.com/blog/jrchiangm\n\ntwitter https://twitter.com/jrchiang2006\n\npinterest https://www.pinterest.com/jrchiang2006/"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT11M24S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "14658", "likeCount": "314", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "129"}}
